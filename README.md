# eulerlib

Function Library for Project Euler Problems

---

## About 
This library contains a collection of utility functions designed to help solve common parts of Project Euler problems more efficiently. The goal is to save time and effort by reusing basic mathematical and algorithmic functions across multiple problems.

---

## Usage
1. **Copy the `eulerlib.h` and `eulerlib.c` files** into your project folder (or any directory of your choice).
   
2. **Include the header file** in your main source code where you want to use the library functions:
   ```c
   #include "eulerlib.h"
   ```

3. **Compile your project** by adding `eulerlib.c` to your compile command:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c eulerlib.c -o your_program_name -lm
   ```

   Replace `your_program_name` with whatever you want to call your compiled executable.
